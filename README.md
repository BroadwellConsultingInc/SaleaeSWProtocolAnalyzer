Protocol Analyzer for I2C protocol of Serial Wombat I/O expansion chips.  See serialwombat.com .

This is quick and dirty, and is my first project using Python, so please be understanding of any issues that come up.  I've been using it myself for some weeks now, and find it quite useful, so I'm going to go ahead and release a beta despite the fact that the code needs some cleanup.
