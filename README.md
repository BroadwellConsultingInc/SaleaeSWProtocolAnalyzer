When using I2C, select the I2C decoder and select I2C as the protocol.

When using UART, it is necessary to use two Serial Wombat Protocol analyzers, one for commands and one for responses (on different pins).  In this case, either UART COMMAND or UART RESPONSE must be selected based on the data direction of the attached pin.
